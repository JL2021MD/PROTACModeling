The original input files and output data pertaining to our paper have been moved to a new repo ([PROTACModeling_InOutDataOnly](https://github.com/JL2021MD/PROTACModeling_InOutDataOnly)) to reduce the size of the current repo. The current repo will now be much smaller and mainly focused on helping researchers quickly be able to start using the MD-based HAPOD scoring method. 

Quick start instructions provided in the README.md file.
