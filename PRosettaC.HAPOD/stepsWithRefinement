#Protonate first. This applies if the ligand needs protonation. The alkyl amines are not fully protonated in the PRosettaC poses.

create tleap and minimize the averaged pose.

#Cluster all the frames from the refinement and take the biggest cluster and its representative for HAPOD.

#Run HAPOD on the representative frame.
